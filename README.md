# Sibelius
Our cool website!

# Tech
This site is hosted on Windows Azure: http://thescienceofcode.azurewebsites.net. Currently, the team
is developing with ASP.Net MVC 5, Mongo DB, Bootstrap and JQuery.

Sibelius is based on an architecture defined by Juan Felipe Ca√±izares. It gives us the right balance
to have everything in order and work as fast as possible.

We hope you enjoy this!
