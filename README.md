# Sibelius
Welcome to the repo of our website http://thescienceofcode.com. 

Currently, the site is being developed with ASP.NET MVC 5, Mongo DB, Bootstrap, Less and JQuery. We are planning to update and improve some components, but in general this is a pretty simple project (in dev terms) that does not require advanced technics or technologies, so we have tried to be as pragmatic as we can.
