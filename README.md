# Sibelius

THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY ON LEGACY MODE. WE ARE PLANNING TO START A BRAND NEW "THE SCIENCE OF CODE".

Welcome to the repo of our website http://thescienceofcode.com. 

The site has been developed with ASP.NET MVC 5, Mongo DB, Bootstrap, Less and JQuery. This was a pretty simple project (in dev terms) that didn't require advanced technics or technologies at the moment that it was done.
