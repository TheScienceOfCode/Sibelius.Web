# Sibelius
Our cool website!

# Tech
This site is hosted on Windows Azure: http://thescienceofcode.azurewebsites.net. Currently, I'm developing with ASP.NET MVC 5, Mongo DB, Bootstrap and JQuery.

Sibelius is based on an architecture defined by Juan Felipe Ca√±izares. It is not strictly a common architecture with tons of patterns and components, but it gives us the right balance to have everything in order and work as fast as possible. ;)
